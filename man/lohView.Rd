\usage{
lohView(x = NULL, path = NULL, fileExt = NULL, y = NULL,
  genome = "hg19", gender = NULL, step = 5e+05, window_size = 1250000,
  normal = 50, gradient_midpoint = 20, gradient_low = "#ffffff",
  gradient_mid = "#b2b2ff", gradient_high = "#000000", theme_layer = NULL,
  method = "slide")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{object of class data frame with rows representing germline calls.
The data frame must contain columns with the following names "chromosome",
"position", "n_vaf", "t_vaf", "sample". required if path is set to NULL (see
details).}

\item{path}{Character string specifying the path to a directory containing
germline calls for each sample. Germline calls are expected to be stored as
tab-seperated files which contain the following column names "chromosome", 
"position", "n_vaf", "t_vaf", and "sample". required if x is set to null
(see details).}

\item{fileExt}{Character string specifying the file extensions of files
within the path specified. Required if argument is supplied to path
(see details).}

\item{y}{Object of class data frame with rows representing chromosome
boundaries for a genome assembly. The data frame must contain columns with
the following names "chromosome", "start", "end" (optional: see details).}

\item{genome}{Character string specifying a valid UCSC genome (see details).}

\item{gender}{Character vector of length equal to the number of samples,
consisting of elements from the set {"M", "F"}. Used to suppress the plotting
of allosomes where appropriate.}

\item{step}{Integer value specifying the step size (i.e. the number of base
pairs to move the window). required when method is set to slide
(see details).}

\item{window_size}{Integer value specifying the size of the window in base
pairs in which to calculate the mean Loss of Heterozygosity (see details).}

\item{normal}{Numeric value within the range 0-50 specifying the expected
normal variant allele frequency to be used in Loss of Heterozygosity 
calculations. defaults to 50\%}

\item{gradient_midpoint}{Numeric value specifying the midpoint 
for the legend's gradient scale.}

\item{gradient_low}{Character string specifying the colour for 
gradient legends low value}

\item{gradient_mid}{Character string specifying the colour for gradient
legends midpoint value.}

\item{gradient_high}{Character string specifying the colour for gradient
legends high value.}

\item{theme_layer}{Valid ggpot2 layer to be added to the plot.}

\item{method}{character string specifying the approach to be used for 
displaying Loss of Heterozygosity, one of "tile" or "slide" (see details).}

\details{
lohView is intended to plot the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) within
a sample. As such lohView expects input data to contain only LOH calls. Input
can be supplied as a single data frame given to the argument x with rows
containing germline calls and variables giving the chromosome, position, 
normal variant allele frequency, tumor variant allele frequency, and the
sample. In lieu of this format a series of .tsv files can be supplied via the 
path and fileExt arguments. If this method is choosen samples will be infered
from the file names. In both cases columns containing the variant allele
frequency for normal and tumor samples should range from 0-100.
Two methods exist to calculate and display LOH events. If the method is set
to "tile" mean LOH is calculated based on the window_size argument with
windows being placed next to each other. If the method is set to slide the
widnow will slide and calculate the LOH based on the step parameter.
In order to ensure the entire chromosome is plotted lohView requries the
location of chromosome boundaries for a given genome assembly. As a
convenience this information is available for the following genomes "hg19",
"hg38", "mm9", "mm10", "rn5" and can be tetrieved by supplying one of the
afore mentioned assemblies via the 'genome'paramter. If an argument is
supplied to the 'genome' parameter and is unrecognized a query to the UCSC
MySQL database will be attempted to obtain the required information. If
chromosome boundary locations are unavailable for a given assembly this
information can be supplied to the 'y' parameter which has priority over the
'genome' parameter.
